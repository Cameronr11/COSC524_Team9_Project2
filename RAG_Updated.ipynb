cried the detective with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. this was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room and no one thought of looking there. the murderer has written it with his or her own blood. see this smear where it has trickled down the wall! that disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. why was that corner chosen to write it on? i will tell you. see that candle on the mantelpiece. it was lit at the time and if it and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law. the more i thought of it the more extraordinary did my companions hypothesis that the man had been poisoned appear. i remembered how he had sniffed his lips and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. then again if not poison what had caused the mans death since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? but on the other hand whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? there were no signs of a struggle nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded by the doorway and greeted my companion and myself. this case will make a stir sir he remarked. it beats anything i have seen and i am no chicken. there is no clue? said gregson. none at all chimed in lestrade. sherlock holmes approached the body and kneeling down examined it intently. you are sure that there is no wound? he asked pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. positive! cried both detectives. then of course this blood belongs to a second individualpresumably the murderer if murder has been committed. it reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of van jansen upon his heart. there was no movement. he was dead! the blood had been streaming from my nose but i had taken no notice of it. i do not know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track for i felt lighthearted and cheerful. i remembered a german being found in new york with rache written up above him and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. i guessed that what puzzled the new yorkers would puzzle the londoners so i dipped my finger in the blood and the writing on the wall and the ring they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent. well done! said holmes in an encouraging voice. really gregson you are getting along. we shall make something of you yet. i flatter myself that i have managed it rather neatly the detective answered proudly. the young man volunteered a statement in which he said that after following drebber some time the latter perceived him and took a cab in order to get away from him. on his way home he met an old shipmate and took a long walk with him. on being asked where this old point that i asked gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to cleveland as to any particular point in mr. drebbers former career. he answered you remember in the negative. i then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderers height and furnished me with the additional details as to the trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. i had already come to the conclusion since there were no signs of a struggle that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderers nose in his excitement. i could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track the length of his nails. i had already come to the conclusion since there were no signs of a struggle that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderers nose in his excitement. i could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. it is seldom that any man unless he is very fullblooded breaks out in this way through emotion so i hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddyfaced man. events proved that i had judged correctly. having left the house i proceeded to do what gregson had neglected. i telegraphed to the head of the police at cleveland limiting act as well whether the blood is old or new. had this test been invented there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes. indeed! i murmured. criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. a man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. his linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them. are they blood stains or mud stains or rust stains or fruit stains or what are they?

that was the question which confronted me. i was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. this murder had on the contrary been done most deliberately and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room showing that he had been there all the time. it must have been a private wrong and not a political one which called for such a methodical revenge. when the inscription was discovered upon the wall i was more inclined than ever to my opinion. the thing was too evidently a blind. when the ring was the case he continued turning to the two detectives. there has been murder done and the murderer was a man. he was more than six feet high was in the prime of life had small feet for his height wore coarse squaretoed boots and smoked a trichinopoly cigar. he came here with his victim in a fourwheeled cab which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. in all probability the murderer had a florid face and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long. these are only a few indications but they may assist you. lestrade and gregson _ daily news _ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. the despotism and hatred of liberalism which animated the continental governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. among these men there was a stringent code of honour any infringement of which was punished by death. every effort should be made to find the secretary stangerson and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. a great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outre _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had the effect of making it less so. mr. gregson who had ##like countenance of the murdered man. so sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that i found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. if ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type they were certainly those of enoch j. drebber of cleveland. still i recognized that justice must be done and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law. the more i thought of it the more extraordinary did my companions hypothesis that the man had been poisoned appear. i remembered how he had sniffed his\n",

that was the question which confronted me. i was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. this murder had on the contrary been done most deliberately and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room showing that he had been there all the time. it must have been a private wrong and not a political one which called for such a methodical revenge. when the inscription was discovered upon the wall i was more inclined than ever to my opinion. the thing was too evidently a blind. when the ring was low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory. this was a lofty chamber lined and littered with countless bottles. broad low tables were scattered about which bristled with retorts testtubes and little bunsen lamps with their blue flickering flames. there was only one student in the room who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. at the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. i have found it! i have found it he shouted to my companion running towards us with a testtube in his hand. i have found a reagent . there is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror. have you seen the evening paper? no. it gives a fairly good account of the affair. it does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up a womans wedding ring fell upon the floor. it is just as well it does not. why? look at this advertisement he answered. i had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair. he threw the paper across to me and i glanced at the place indicated. it was the first announcement in the found column. in brixton road this morning . he noticed that a ladder which usually lay there was raised against one of the windows of the second floor which was wide open. after passing he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. he took no particular notice of him beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. he has an impression that the man was tall had a reddish face and was dressed in a long brownish coat. he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder for we found bloodsta other wives mourned over her and sat up with her the night before the burial as is the mormon custom. they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning when to their inexpressible fear and astonishment the door was flung open and a savagelooking weatherbeaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. without a glance or a word to the cowering women he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier. stooping over her he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead and then snatching up her hand he took the wedding and that the night was still very wild. i had driven some distance when i put my hand into the pocket in which i usually kept lucys ring and found that it was not there. i was thunderstruck at this for it was the only memento that i had of her. thinking that i might have dropped it when i stooped over drebbers body i drove back and leaving my cab in a side street i went boldly up to the housefor i was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. when i arrived there i walked right into the arms of a policeofficer who was coming out and only and carried out. as they raised him a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes. theres been a woman here he cried. its a womans weddingring. he held it out as he spoke upon the palm of his hand. we all gathered round him and gazed at it. there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride. this complicates matters said gregson. heaven knows they were complicated enough before. you are sure it does not simplify them?

that was the question which confronted me. i was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. this murder had on the contrary been done most deliberately and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room showing that he had been there all the time. it must have been a private wrong and not a political one which called for such a methodical revenge. when the inscription was discovered upon the wall i was more inclined than ever to my opinion. the thing was too evidently a blind. when the ring was trickled down the wall! that disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. why was that corner chosen to write it on?

asked a clear but rather harsh voice. we could not hear the servants reply but the door closed and some one began to ascend the stairs. the footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. a look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the underground and asked to give the trades of all his fellowtravellers. i would lay a thousand to one against him. you would lose your money sherlock holmes remarked calmly. as for the article i wrote it myself. you! yes i have a turn both for observation and for deduction. the theories which i have expressed there and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practicalso practical that i depend upon them for my bread and cheese. and how? i asked involuntarily. well i have a trade of my own. i have no doubt that he has caught him by this time. the idea tickled gregson so much that he laughed until he choked. and how did you get your clue? ah i will tell you all about it. of course doctor watson this is strictly between ourselves. the first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this americans antecedents. some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered or until parties came forward and volunteered information. that is not tobias gregsons way of going to work. you remember the hat beside the dead man?

they both asked. it would be robbing you of the credit of the case if i was to presume to help you remarked my friend. you are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere. there was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. if you will let me know how your i had to prop him upme and murcher between us. he was a long chap with a red face the lower part muffled round that will do cried holmes. what became of him?

he asked in undisguised wonder own account as duly recorded in dr. watsons journal to which we are already under such obligations. our prisoners furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves for on finding himself powerless he smiled in an affable manner and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. i guess you are going to take me to the policestation he remarked to sherlock holmes. my cabs at the door. if you will loose my legs i will walk down to it. i am not so light to lift as i used to be. gregson and lestrade exchanged glances as if they\n",

i felt a creeping of the flesh and a presentiment of coming horror even before sherlock holmes answered. the word rache written in letters of blood he said. that was it said lestrade in an awestruck voice and we were all silent for a while. there was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. my nerves which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as i thought of it. the man was seen continued lestrade. holmes curtly and strode off. one other thing lestrade he added turning round at the door rache is the german for revenge so do not lose your time looking for miss rachel. with which parthian shot he walked away leaving the two rivals openmouthed behind him. it was one of the clock when we left no. 3 lauriston gardens. sherlock holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office whence he dispatched a long telegram. he then hailed a cab and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by lestrade. there is nothing like first hand evidence he remarked as a matter of fact my mind is entirely ##rade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. i stared in silence at sherlock holmes whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes. stangerson too! he muttered. the plot thickens. it was quite thick enough before grumbled lestrade taking a chair. i seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war. are youare you sure of this piece of intelligence? stammered gregson. i have just come from his room said lestrade. i was the first of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. now stand there! he struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall. look at that! he said triumphantly. i have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. in this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. across this bare space there was scrawled in bloodred letters a single word rache. what do you think of that? cried the detective with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. this was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. in all probability the murderer had a florid face and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long. these are only a few indications but they may assist you. lestrade and gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile. if this man was murdered how was it done? asked the former. poison said sherlock holmes curtly and strode off. one other thing lestrade he added turning round at the door rache is the german for revenge so do not lose your time looking for miss rachel. with which parthian shot he walked away leaving the two rivals open packed it away in an envelope. finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. this done he appeared to be satisfied for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket. they say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains he remarked with a smile. its a very bad definition but it does apply to detective work. gregson and lestrade had watched the manœuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. they evidently failed to appreciate the fact which i had begun to realize that sherlock holmes smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and on which the name rance was engraved. on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming. he appeared presently looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers. i made my report at the office he said. holmes took a halfsovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. we thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips he said. i shall be most happy to tell you anything i can the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk. just let us hear it all\n",

stammered gregson. i have just come from his room said lestrade. i was the first it was a very unheard of idea. the forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. the cases of dolsky in odessa and of leturier in montpellier will occur at once to any toxicologist. and now came the great question as to the reason why. robbery had not been the object of the murder for nothing was taken. was it politics then or was it a woman?

            "Context: i see that i have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. these were very remarkable but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. that he could play pieces and difficult pieces i knew well because at my request he has played me some of mendelssohns lieder and other favourites. when left to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. leaning back in his armchair of an evening he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him but whether the music aided those thoughts or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than i could determine. i might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience. during the first week or so we had no callers and i had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as i was myself. presently however i found that he had many acquaintances and those in the most different classes of society. there was one little sallow rat doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. then again if not poison what had caused the mans death since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? but on the other hand whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? there were no signs of a struggle nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. as long as all these questions were unsolved i felt that sleep would be no easy matter either for holmes or myself. his quiet selfconfident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts though what it was i could not for an instant conjecture. he was very late in returningso late that i knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. dinner was on the table before he appeared. it was magnificent he said as he took his seat. do you remember what darwin says about music? he claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. there are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.

triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. for a second or two we

made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until as he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. sherlock holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. we heard the servant pass along the hall and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it. does dr. watson live here? asked a clear but rather harsh voice. we could not hear the servants reply but the door closed and some one began to ascend the stairs. the footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. a look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. it came slowly along the passage and there was a feeble tap at the door. come in i cried. at my summons instead of the man of violence whom we expected a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. she appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light and after dropping a curtsey she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous shaky fingers. i glanced at my companion and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all i could do to keep my countenance. the old crone drew out an evening paper and pointed at our advertisement. its this as has brought me good gentlemen she said dropping another curtsey a this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct. it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth. all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it. hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outre _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had goodbye i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance. we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no. 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting. they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows. so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession. that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning. sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of then let us go and look at the room. with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house followed by gregson whose features expressed his astonishment. a short passage bare planked and dusty led to the kitchen and offices. two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. one of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. the other belonged to the diningroom which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. holmes walked in and i followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. it was a large square room looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. a vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls but it was blotched in places with mildew and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down exposing the yellow plaster beneath. opposite the door was a showy fireplace surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. on one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. the solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain giving a dull grey tinge to everything which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment. all these details i observed afterwards. at present my attention was centred upon the single grim i felt a creeping of the flesh and a presentiment of coming horror even before sherlock holmes answered. the word rache written in letters of blood he said. that was it

intimation that i was ready. then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast. one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it. its somewhat ambitious title was the book of life and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated. the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a mans inmost thoughts. deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. his conclusions were as infallible as so many proposition i felt a creeping of the flesh and a presentiment of coming horror even before sherlock holmes answered. the word rache written in letters of blood he said. that was it said lestrade in an awestruck voice and we were all silent for a while. there was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. my nerves which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as i thought of it. the man was seen continued lestrade. a milk boy passing on his way to the dairy happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. he noticed that a ladder which usually lay there was raised against one of the windows of the second floor which was wide open. after passing he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. he took no particular notice of him beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. he has an impression that the man was tall had a reddish face and was dressed in a long brownish coat. he must with many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket and shuffled off down the stairs. sherlock holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. he returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. i will follow her he said hurriedly she must be an accomplice and will lead me to him. wait up for me. the hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before holmes had descended the stair. looking through the window i could see her walking feebly along the other side while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind. either his whole theory is incorrect i thought to myself or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery. there was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him for i felt that sleep was impossible until i heard the result of his adventure. it was close upon nine when he set out. i had no idea how long he might be but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murgers vie de boheme. ten of the clock passed and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. eleven and the more stately the whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that i had no time to realize it. i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. for a second or two we might have been a group of statues. then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmess grasp and hurled himself through the window. woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict. so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until goodbye i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance. we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no. 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting. they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows. so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession. that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning. sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of\n",

asked a clear but rather harsh voice. we could not hear the servants reply but the door closed and some one began to ascend the stairs. the footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. a look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. it came slowly along the passage and there was a feeble tap at the door. come in i cried. at my summons instead of the man of violence whom we expected a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. she appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light and after dropping a curtsey she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous shaky fingers. i glanced at my companion and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all i could do to keep my countenance. the old crone drew out an evening paper and pointed at our advertisement. its this as has brought me good gentlemen she said dropping another curtsey a as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier who speedily licked it dry. sherlock holmes earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence watching the animal intently and expecting some startling effect. none such appeared however. the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion breathing in a laboured way but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught. holmes had taken out his watch and as minute followed minute without result an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. he gnawed his lip drummed his fingers upon the table and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. so great was his emotion that i felt sincerely sorry for him while the two detectives smiled derisively by no means displeased at this check which he had met. it cannot be a coincidence he cried at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. the very pills which i suspected in the case of drebber are actually found after the death of stangerson. and yet they are inert. what can it mean? surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false . it is impossible! and yet this wretched dog is none the worse. ah i have it! i have it! with a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box cut the other pill in two dissolved it added milk and presented it to the terrier. the unfortunate creatures tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. sherlock holmes drew a long breath and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. i should have more faith he said i ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison and the other was entirely harmless. i ought to have known that before ever i saw the box at all. reason to remember that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready. then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast. one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it. its somewhat ambitious title was the book of life and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated. the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a mans inmost thoughts. deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. his conclusions were as infallible as so many proposition goodbye i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance. we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no. 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting. they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows. so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession. that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning. sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of Not a doubt of that said Holmes heartily.

Where are you going? and i hung about all day but he never came out. i fancy that he suspected something when drebber failed to put in an appearance. he was cunning was stangerson and always on his guard. if he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. i soon found out which was the window of his bedroom and early next morning i took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. i woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. i described drebbers death to him and i gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. in selfdefence i stabbed him to the heart. it would have been the same in any case for providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison. i have little more to say and its as well for i am about done up. i went on cabbing it for a day or so intending to keep at it until i could save enough to take me back to it was the _ echo _ for the day and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question. the public it said have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man hope who was suspected of the murder of mr. enoch drebber and of mr. joseph stangerson. the details of the case will probably be never known now though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud in which love and mormonism bore a part. it seems that both the victims belonged in their younger days to the latter day saints and hope the deceased prisoner hails also from salt lake city. if the case has had no other effect it at least brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home and not to carry them on to british soil. it is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the wellknown scotland yard officials messrs. lestrade and gregson. the man was apprehended it appears in the rooms of a certain mr. sherlock holmes who has himself as an amateur shown some talent in the detective line and him. his companion remonstrated with him and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one and that he must go alone. i could not catch what stangerson said to that but the other burst out swearing and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant and that he must not presume to dictate to him. on that the secretary gave it up as a bad job and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at hallidays private hotel to which drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven and made his way out of the station. the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come. i had my enemies within my power. together they could protect each other but singly they were at my mercy. i did not act however with undue precipitation. my plans were already formed. there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him and why retribution has come upon him. i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. it was claimed that same evening and returned but in the interval i had taken a moulding of it and had a duplicate constructed. by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon being free from interruption. how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve. he walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops staying for nearly halfanhour in the last of them. when he came out he staggered in his walk and was evidently pretty well on. there was a hansom just in front of me and he hailed it. i followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. we rattled across waterloo bridge and through miles of streets until to my astonishment we found ourselves back in the terrace in which he had boarded. i could not imagine what his intention was in returning there but i went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. he entered it and his hansom drove away. give me a glass of water\n",

            "dead man? Yes said Holmes by John Underwood and Sons 129 Camberwell Road. the whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that i had no time to realize it. i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. for a second or two we might have been a group of statues. then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmess grasp and hurled himself through the window. woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict. so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until as he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. sherlock holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. we heard the servant pass along the hall and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it. does dr. watson live here? asked a clear but rather harsh voice. we could not hear the servants reply but the door closed and some one began to ascend the stairs. the footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. a look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. it came slowly along the passage and there was a feeble tap at the door. come in i cried. at my summons instead of the man of violence whom we expected a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. she appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light and after dropping a curtsey she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous shaky fingers. i glanced at my companion and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all i could do to keep my countenance. the old crone drew out an evening paper and pointed at our advertisement. its this as has brought me good gentlemen she said dropping another curtsey a this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct. it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth. all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it. hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outre _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had goodbye i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance. we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no. 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting. they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows. so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession. that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning. sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of then let us go and look at the room. with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house followed by gregson whose features expressed his astonishment. a short passage bare planked and dusty led to the kitchen and offices. two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. one of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. the other belonged to the diningroom which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. holmes walked in and i followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. it was a large square room looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. a vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls but it was blotched in places with mildew and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down exposing the yellow plaster beneath. opposite the door was a showy fireplace surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. on one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. the solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain giving a dull grey tinge to everything which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment. all these details i observed afterwards. at present my attention was centred upon the single grim i felt a creeping of the flesh and a presentiment of coming horror even before sherlock holmes answered. the word rache written in letters of blood he said. that was it said lestrade in an awestruck voice and we were all silent for a while. there was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. my nerves which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as i thought of it. the man was seen continued lestrade. a milk boy passing on his way to the dairy happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. he noticed that a ladder which usually lay there was raised against one of the windows of the second floor which was wide open. after passing he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. he took no particular notice of him beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. he has an impression that the man was tall had a reddish face and was dressed in a long brownish coat.

Yes said Holmes by John Underwood and Sons 129 Camberwell Road. this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct. it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth. all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it. hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outre _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had the whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that i had no time to realize it. i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. for a second or two we might have been a group of statues. then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmess grasp and hurled himself through the window. woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict. so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until Well my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\n",

he claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. there are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood. . a great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boardeda result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of mr. gregson of scotland yard. sherlock holmes and i read these notices over together at breakfast and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement. i told you that whatever happened lestrade and gregson would be sure to score. goodbye i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance. we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no. 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting. they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows. so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession. that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning. sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that i had no time to realize it. i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. for a second or two we might have been a group of statues. then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmess grasp and hurled himself through the window. woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict. so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier who speedily licked it dry. sherlock holmes earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence watching the animal intently and expecting some startling effect. none such appeared however. the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion breathing in a laboured way but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught. holmes had taken out his watch and as minute followed minute without result an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. he gnawed his lip drummed his fingers upon the table and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. so great was his emotion that i felt sincerely sorry for him while the two detectives smiled derisively by no means displeased at this check which he had met. it cannot be a coincidence he cried at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. the very pills which i suspected in the case of drebber are actually found after the death of stangerson. and yet they are inert. what can it mean?

My case is complete. leaning back in the cab this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while i meditated upon the manysidedness of the human mind. our mornings exertions had been too much for my weak health and i was tired out in the afternoon. after holmes departure for the concert i lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours sleep. it was a useless attempt. my mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. every time that i closed my eyes i saw before me the distorted baboonlike countenance of the murdered man. so sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that i found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. if ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type they were certainly those of enoch j. drebber of cleveland. still i recognized that justice must be done and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law. the more i thought of it the more extraordinary did my companions hypothesis that the man had been poisoned appear. i remembered how he had sniffed his lips and had no the whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that i had no time to realize it. i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. for a second or two we might have been a group of statues. then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmess grasp and hurled himself through the window. woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict. so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until This is the letter which I read to him MY DEAR MR.

i laughed as i saw it and held lucys marriage ring in front of his eyes. it was but for a moment for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. a spasm of pain contorted his features he threw his hands out in front of him staggered and then with a hoarse cry fell heavily upon the floor. i turned him over with my foot and placed my hand upon his heart. there was no movement. he was dead! the blood had been streaming from my nose but i had taken no notice of it. i do not know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track for i felt lighthearted and cheerful. i remembered a german being found in new york with rache written up above him and it was and of having their houses guarded. after a time they were able to relax these measures for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. far from doing so it had if anything augmented it. the hunters mind was of a hard unyielding nature and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. he was however above all things practical. he soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. if he died like a dog among the mountains what was to become of his revenge then? and yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. he felt that that was to play his enemys game so he reluctantly returned to the old nevada mines there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation. his intention had been to be absent a year at the most but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. at the end of that time however his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen\n",

If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice. Would he not consider it as too dangerous? motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. it was that of a man about fortythree or fortyfour years of age middlesized broad shouldered with crisp curling black hair and a short stubbly beard. he was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat with lightcoloured trousers and immaculate collar and cuffs. a top hat well brushed and trim was placed upon the floor beside him. his hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. on his rigid face there stood an expression of horror and as it seemed to me of hatred such as i have never seen upon human features. this malignant and terrible contortion combined with the low forehead blunt nose and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and apelike appearance which was increased by his writhing unnatural posture. i have seen death in many forms but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban london. lestrade lean and ferretlike as ever was standing by the doorway and greeted my companion particular point in mr. drebbers former career. he answered you remember in the negative. i then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderers height and furnished me with the additional details as to the trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. i had already come to the conclusion since there were no signs of a struggle that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderers nose in his excitement. i could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. it is seldom that any man unless he is very fullblooded breaks out in this way through emotion so i hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddyfaced man. events proved that i had judged correctly. having left the house i proceeded to do what gregson had neglected. i telegraphed to the head of the police at cleveland limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of enoch drebber. the answer was conclusive. it told me that drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love named jefferson hope and that this same hope was at present in europe. i knew now that i held the clue to the mystery what if we are stopped asked ferrier. hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic. if they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us he said with a sinister smile. the lights inside the house had all been extinguished and from the darkened window ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own and which he was now about to abandon for ever. he had long nerved himself to the sacrifice however and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. all looked so peaceful and happy the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grainland that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head. ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. opening the window very slowly and carefully they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night and then one by one passed through into the little garden. with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it and The finger nails and the Trichinopoly I suggested.

Yes said Holmes by John Underwood and Sons 129 Camberwell Road. the whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that i had no time to realize it. i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabmans dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. for a second or two we might have been a group of statues. then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmess grasp and hurled himself through the window. woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict. so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct. it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth. all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it. hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outre _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had with many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket and shuffled off down the stairs. sherlock holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. he returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. i will follow her he said hurriedly she must be an accomplice and will lead me to him. wait up for me. the hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before holmes had descended the stair. looking through the window i could see her walking feebly along the other side while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind. either his whole theory is incorrect i thought to myself or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery. there was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him for i felt that sleep was impossible until i heard the result of his adventure. it was close upon nine when he set out. i had no idea how long he might be but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murgers vie de boheme. ten of the clock passed and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. eleven and the more stately\n",

            "Context: reason to remember that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready. then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast. one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it. its somewhat ambitious title was the book of life and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated. the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a mans inmost thoughts. deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. his conclusions were as infallible as so many proposition this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct. it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth. all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it. hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outre _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had You do me too much honour said Holmes gravely.

Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done? ##faced darkeyed fellow who was introduced to me as mr. lestrade and who came three or four times in a single week. one morning a young girl called fashionably dressed and stayed for half an hour or more. the same afternoon brought a greyheaded seedy visitor looking like a jew pedlar who appeared to me to be much excited and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. on another occasion an old whitehaired gentleman had an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. when any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance sherlock holmes used to beg for the use of the sittingroom and i would retire to my bedroom. he always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. i have to use this room as a place of business he said and these people are my clients. again i had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. i imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord. it was upon the 4th of march as i have good\n",

            "Context: Holmes believed that knowledge not directly relevant to his work should be discarded, arguing that the brain has limited capacity, which should not be cluttered with irrelevant facts.\n",
            "Question: What was Holmes' argument against cluttering the brain?\n",
            "Answer: which should not be cluttered with irrelevant facts.\n",
            "Genrated:\n",
            "Context: reason to remember that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready. then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast. one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it. its somewhat ambitious title was the book of life and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated. the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a mans inmost thoughts. deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. his conclusions were as infallible as so many proposition this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct. it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth. all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it. hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outre _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had You do me too much honour said Holmes gravely.
